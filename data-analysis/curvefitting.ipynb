    "The general case\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "In many cases of data analysis we want to estimate some parameters.\n",
    "In other words, we have a *model* of the data which depends on\n",
    "a set of parameters, say $a_1,\\dots,a_M$ which we want to fit\n",
    "to our data points $\\{x_i,y_i,u_i\\}, i=1\\dots N$.\n",
    "Here, $u_i$ is the (measured or estimated) uncertainty in $y_i$;\n",
    "we assume that the uncertainties in $x_i$ are small. This is often a good\n",
    "assumption; if the uncertainties in $x_i$ are *not* small, then the fitting\n",
    "procedure is a *lot* messier. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can express our model as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(x)=f(x\\,|\\,a_1,\\dots,a_M)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "How do we proceed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us rephrase things a little. Suppose we are given a set of\n",
    "parameters $\\{a\\}$. What is the probability that we obtain the \n",
    "data $y(x_i)=f(x_i\\,|\\,a_1,\\dots,a_M)$? *Given* a probabilty density function (pdf) $p_y(y)$ which \n",
    "describes this probability, and *assuming* that the measurements\n",
    "are independent, the probability of finding each $y(x_i)$ in $(y,y+\\delta y)$\n",
    "is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{data}\\,|\\,\\text{model})=\\prod_{i=1}^N\\,p_y(y(x_i))\\,\\delta y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(We read this as \"the probability of the data given the model\").\n",
    "In the absence of further information we *assume* that $p_y$\n",
    "is given by a normal distribution,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_y(y(x_i))=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_i}e^{-(f(x_i\\,|\\,\\{a\\})-y_i)^2/2\\sigma_i^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We *assume* that the standard deviations of the pdfs are given\n",
    "by the experimental uncertainties, $\\sigma_i=u_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what we actually want is not $P(\\text{data}\\,|\\,\\text{model})$\n",
    "but $P(\\text{model}\\,|\\,\\text{data})$. We would like to maximise this\n",
    "latter quantity by adjusting the model parameters.\n",
    "Fortunately, we know that Bayes' theorem tells us that\n",
    "$P(\\text{model}\\,|\\,\\text{data})\\propto P(\\text{data}\\,|\\,\\text{model})P(\\text{model})$.\n",
    "If we know *nothing* about $P(\\text{model})$, we can *assume*\n",
    "that is a flat distribution --- all parameters are likely, a priori.\n",
    "(This is known as an uninformative prior in the game).\n",
    "The result is that maximising $P(\\text{model}\\,|\\,\\text{data})$ is equivalent\n",
    "to maximising $P(\\text{data}\\,|\\,\\text{model})$, i.e. maximising\n",
    "$$\n",

    "i.e. we minimise the sum of the squares of the weighted difference between\n",

    "\n",
    "Statistics tells us that under all those assumptions above, \n",
    "$\\chi^2$ is distributed according to the chi-squared distribution\n",
    "of $N-M$ degrees of freedom, $\\chi^2_{N-M}(x)$, with expectation value $N-M$.\n",
    "Thus we expect that $\\chi^2/(N-M)$, the reduced chi-squared, has a value\n",
    "close to one. We will take this as an indication of a \"good fit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We still have to *minimise* $\\chi^2$. If our model is simple,\n",
    "this can be done analytically, e.g for the straight line\n",
